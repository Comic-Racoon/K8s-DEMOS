Exporter ?

Translator between app data to Prometheus understable metrics 

i.e, it translates application data/metric to metric/data
that prometheus can understand 

its responsibilities includes 
a) it fetches the data from the Target(app/service) 
b) converts into correct format that prometheus can understand 
c) expose /metric endpopint that prometheus will be able to scrap

we can search exporter in the official promethius website 
or we can also search them on the docker hub to deploy them 

need to have 3 thing(component) in place before deploying exporter 
- Exporter application
    (exposes/metric endpints)
- Service
    (for connection to the exporter)
- ServiceMoniter
    # to let prometheus know that there is new end point to be scrapped
    (to be discovered)
