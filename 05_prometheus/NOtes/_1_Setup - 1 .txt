Step 1

installing prometheus operator
# insall operator using command 
    -- helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --version "9.4.1"
    -- kubectl get all 

# operator has been set up 
# we can port forword to access grifana and promethius ui 

Step 2 

installing mongodb deployment

    # helm show values prometheus-community/prometheus-mongodb-exporter

        in the community we need to overide two things 

        mongodb:
           # service enpoint "mongodb://<mongo service name>:<mongo service port>"
           uri: "mongodb://mongo-service:27017"

        add additional label in service moniter 

        ServiceMoniter:
           # releale prometheus lable is needed by all the service 
           # moniter so that the end-point(/metric) can get detected(registered) by the prometheus 
           additionalLables: 
              release: promrtheus

step 3
