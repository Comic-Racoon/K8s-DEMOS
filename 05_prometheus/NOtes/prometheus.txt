1) What is Prometheus ?

->  * prometheus was created to monitor highly dynamic container environments like
        kubernetes docker swarm etc however itcan also be used in a traditional
        non-container infrastructure where you have just bare servers with applications
        deployed directly on it
    * 

2) Where and why is Prometheus used ?

    * typically we have multiple servers that run containerized application and there 
        are 100's of diff processes running on same infrastructure so to run smoohly 
        without application downtime is very challenging 
    * In complex infrastructure there are many things which can go wrong when we have
        tons of services and applications deployed and dependes on one another 
    * If one service or application crashes can cuse failuer to another service 
    * So the de-bugging becomes time consumeing 

    eg :- 

    Prometheus is such automated monitoring and alearting tool   

3) Prometheus Architecture ?

    * it has main 3 components 
    * 1 ->  Prometheus Server ( which does the actual monitering work )

            it has 3 parts 

            a)  Storage (Time Series Database )
                - Which stores metric data  eg:- Cpu Usage, No. of Exceptions occurs
            
            b)  Data Retrival worker 
                - it pulls the metric data from
                    - applications
                    - Services 
                    - servers
                    - and other taget resources 
                    and stores or pushes them into the Storage(Time Series Database)

            c) HTTP server 
                - it has web server which accepts queries 
                - the server api is used to display in 
                    Prometheus Web Ui or data visualizatoin tool like GRIFANA 
    
    * 2 ->  Target and metric 

            -> Prometheus monitor a particular thing that thing can be 
                    - linux/Windows server
                    - Single application
                    - Apache Server
                    - Serice Like db 
                * and a thing that prometheus monitor is called target 
                    - targets have units that can be monitered 
                        eg- a linux server could have - CPU Status 
                                                      - Memory or disk Usage
                                                      - Request count 
                                                      - Request Duration
                                                      - Exception count 
                                                These are called Metric 
                                                These get stored in Database (Time Series Database)

    * 3 -> Metric 

            -> It is in human readable text-base  format 
            -> Metric entries: Type and HELP attribute 

                    HELP -> Description of what metric is 
                    Type -> 3 Types
                            1)  Counter (How many times thing has happened )
                            2)  Gauge   (What is current value of "X" now )
                            3)  Histogram (How low or how big ?)
        


--- correct format and application/ service should expose service 
--- exporter 

--- aleart manager 

--- use operator ---(maintained by helm community )
